Each bulb is toggled in the following way:
	‚Ä¢	Bulb i is toggled once for every divisor of i.

Example:

For bulb 6:
	‚Ä¢	Toggled in round 1 (1 divides 6)
	‚Ä¢	Round 2 (2 divides 6)
	‚Ä¢	Round 3 (3 divides 6)
	‚Ä¢	Round 6 (6 divides 6)
‚Üí total of 4 toggles

So we can generalize:

A bulb ends up ON if it is toggled an odd number of times.

üîç Key Insight: When does a number have an odd number of divisors?
	‚Ä¢	Usually, divisors come in pairs:
e.g. 12 ‚Üí (1,12), (2,6), (3,4) ‚Üí even number of divisors;
        Bulbs 1, 4, 9 will stay on because among 12 bulbs only these bulbs will be toggled n number of times
	‚Ä¢	But for perfect squares, one of the divisors is repeated:
e.g. 6 ‚Üí Bulbs 1 and 4 will stay on

‚úÖ So: Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors ‚Üí Only perfect square bulbs stay ON.
