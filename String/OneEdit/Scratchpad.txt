Solution 1 - Intuitive Solution
* Breakdown the solution into 3 cases.
* Case 1: If the lengths of both the strings are equal, then see if there are more than 1 differnce in character.
            If the difference is more than 1, return False.
* Case 2: If the difference in lengths of strings is more than 1, then both the strings cannot be made equal with only
            one edit.
* Case 3: In this case, you can either remove 1 char or add 1 char.
            As you compare the characters, see if you have more than 1 difference of character. If yes, return False.
            If you find the 1st difference, increment index of longer string, else increment index for both the strings.

# Time - O(n), where n = length of shorter string.
# Space - O(1)
